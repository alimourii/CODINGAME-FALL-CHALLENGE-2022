# Codingame Challenge 2022 - Rank 420 Worldwide ðŸš€

## Description
I participated in the CodingGame Fall Challenge 2022, my first experience on the platform. I implemented a heuristic programming approach in C to solve the challenge. This involved designing algorithms that made educated guesses and prioritized certain actions based on heuristic evaluation, enabling efficient decision-making within the game's context. It was an exciting opportunity to apply coding skills to a competitive programming environment and tackle complex problems creatively.

## Overview
I participated in the Codingame Challenge 2022 and achieved a global ranking of 420! It was an exciting experience and I'm thrilled to share my journey with you.
